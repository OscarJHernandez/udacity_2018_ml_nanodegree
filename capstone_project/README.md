# Udacity Capstone Project

This directory contain all code that was used for the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009t) Program. 
The folder [figures](figures/) contains all of the pdf figures generated by the codes. The links to the project proposal and the write-up of the final 
project are below.

* [The project proposal: project_proposal.pdf](project_proposal.pdf)
* [The write up of the final project: final_project_write_up.pdf](final_project_write_up.pdf) 

The enviroments needed to run the program can be installed from the requirements.txt in anaconda using the following command:   
$ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt  

# Project Summary

In this project we have taken data for time series data $(t,X_t)$ and we have trained two different neural network models,
 the feed forward neural network (FFNN) and the long-short term memory (LSTM) network, denoted as
  $G_{\rm FFNN}$ ,$G_{\rm LSTM}$ respectively; to generate a time series forecast given the value of the time series
   at the previous time step. In other words, we have generated a function $G$ such that  
$G(X_{t}) = F_{t+1}$  
where $F_{t+1}$ is similar to the $X_{t+1}$ value of the underlying time series data. 
This problem was very interesting to me as it introduced me the complexity of time-series analysis.
